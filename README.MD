Install from git

git clone https://github.com/deepmipt/deeppavlov
cd deeppavlov
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```

Run model training
```sh
pyb train_<model_name>
```
Run model testing
```sh
pyb run_unit_tests -P unittest_test_method_prefix="test_<model_name>"
```
where <model_name> should be replaced with the name of the model from the library: ner, paraphraser, insults, squad.

To test all the models use
```sh
pyb run_unit_tests -v
```
After that, test metrics could be found within ./build/kpi_score_reports.txt file and detailed output could be found in target/reports.
